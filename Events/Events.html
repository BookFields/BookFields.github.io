	<div><h2>Books, Gourmet Food, and Library Love at the Queen Mary</h2>
	<p>What’s better than a Day of the Dead book event that offers gourmet dining, and takes place on an 85-year-old, Art Deco, haunted ship? How about one that offers all that, and raises money for a new library?

This fall, the RMS Queen Mary will debut a spectacular event for literature and library lovers, history buffs, ship aficionados, and gourmet foodies, at the Queen Mary Secret Spice Cafe Dinner and Tour, on Saturday, November 2, 2019 in Long Beach, California.</p></div>
